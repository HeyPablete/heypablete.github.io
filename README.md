My personal website. Just a simple presentation card.

Created with pure JavaScript and CSS.
- The CSS contains the site styles and animations and the JavaScript controls the execution times to launch these CSS animations.

If you have any doubt, will be a pleasure for me to answer.
You can ask me on twitter at @PableraShow or write me a e-mail at pablerashow@gmail.com

If you want to have your own site version, would be great y motivador make a fork in the project. I'd love to read your version.

Cheers!
