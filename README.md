**Created with pure JavaScript and CSS**

Results of PageSpeed Insights at 11/08/2016:
- SmartPhone: 91/100
- Computer: 100/100
The result on SmartPhone isn't 100/100 because GitHub Pages can't edit the browser cache.

If you want to have your own site version, would be great y motivador make a fork in the project. I'd love to read your version.

Cheers!
